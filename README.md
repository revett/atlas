Atlas is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool that is **built for those
that enjoy using a CLI** and use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as their daily code
editor. It is a niche personal knowledge management
([PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)) solution built primarily for
developers who value simplicity, speed and consistent hierarchical note structure.

## Install

📦 The project is yet to make the `v1.0.0` release; please watch the GitHub repo (top-right) for
future updates.

## Roadmap

🗂 See [Projects](https://github.com/users/revett/projects/1).

## Why?

Atlas is a niche tool in the PKM ecosystem that was originally developed by
[@revett](https://revcd.com) as a Bash script after becoming frustrated with overly complex
GUI-based tools. It will appeal to those that:

- Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as their daily code editor
- Prefer to use a CLI to create and manage notes in a knowledge base
- Value consistent hierarchical note structure, simplicity, and speed

The project has taken inspiration from [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron), and can be
seen as a lightweight alternative that is CLI focused.

## Features

</p>

Atlas is made up of three parts, each providing different features for the user:

- CLI
- VS Code and the [Memo extension](https://github.com/svsool/memo) by
  [@svsool](https://github.com/svsool)
- Web app

### Why Use an Extension?

[Svyat Sobol (@svsool)](https://github.com/svsool) has done an incredible job with the extension;
which provides all the required core features. Therefore, it seemed logical to focus on additional
features provided by the CLI and web app instead of duplicating effort.
