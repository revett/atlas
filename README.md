# Atlas

Atlas is a note-taking tool for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It is built for
those who value simplicity and speed, and uses a hierarchical note structure.

You can use Atlas to organize your code snippets, keep meeting notes, maintain a personal journal,
write long-form content, and much more.

It is free, open-source, local-first, and markdown-based. Atlas can be customized to suit your
personal workflow, and you always own the information you create.

## Install

🛠️ → [**Install the Atlas extension**](vscode:extension/revett.atlas) in Visual Studio Code.

## Roadmap

🗂 See [TODO.md](https://github.com/revett/atlas/blob/main/TODO.md).

## Why?

Atlas was originally created as a Bash script in May 2022 (see
[commit](https://github.com/revett/atlas/commit/ef85ce9d70593c8b3dfb8e1c2aab56300bbee959)), as I had
become frustrated with overly complex tools that got in the way of writing and required too much
configuration. I still believe this is the case with many of the tools in the ecosystem, and that
there is space for a tool designed with simplicity, speed, and sensible defaults in mind.
