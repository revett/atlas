Atlas is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool that is **built for those
that enjoy using a CLI** and use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as their daily code
editor. It is a niche personal knowledge management
([PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)) solution built primarily for
developers who value simplicity, speed and consistent hierarchical note structure.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:revett/atlas.git
```

```
cd atlas/
```

```
make install-cli-locally
```

```
echo "path: ~/notes" > ~/.atlas-notes.yml
```

## Usage

All notes in Atlas must use a base type, from the following:

- `area`
- `entity`
- `meeting`
- `project`
- `scratch`
- `system`

```bash
atlas {type}
```

```bash
atlas scratch
```

### Flags

```bash
# Before creating the new note, run the doctor command.
atlas {type} --auto-doctor

# Disable validation.
atlas {type} --auto-doctor=false
```

```bash
# Append a code snippet Markdown section to the note.
atlas {type} --code-snippet
```

### Doctor

```bash
atlas doctor
```

### Shell Completion

```bash
atlas completion -h
```

## Roadmap

ðŸ—‚ See [TODO.md](https://github.com/revett/atlas/blob/main/TODO.md).

## Why?

Atlas is a niche tool in the PKM ecosystem that was originally developed by
[@revett](https://revcd.com) as a Bash script after becoming frustrated with overly complex
GUI-based tools. It will appeal to those that:

- Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as their daily code editor
- Prefer to use a CLI to create and manage notes in a knowledge base
- Value consistent hierarchical note structure, simplicity, and speed

The project has taken inspiration from [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron), and can be
seen as a lightweight alternative that is CLI focused.

## Features

</p>

Atlas is made up of three parts, each providing different features for the user:

- CLI
- VS Code and the [Memo extension](https://github.com/svsool/memo) by
  [@svsool](https://github.com/svsool)
- Web app

### Why Use an Extension?

[Svyat Sobol (@svsool)](https://github.com/svsool) has done an incredible job with the extension;
which provides all the required core features. Therefore, it seemed logical to focus on additional
features provided by the CLI and web app instead of duplicating effort.
